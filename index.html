        <summary>Why is the moon sometimes out during the day?</summary>
        <p>In order for the moon to be visible in the sky, it needs to be above the
           horizon. On average, the moon is above the horizon 12 hours a day. Some
           of those 12 hours are bound to coincide with the sun's—producing a daytime
           moon. Which, despite how exciting it can be to see, isn't that rare.</p>
